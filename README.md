- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheLobsterDr
- 👀 I’m a marine biologist and fisheries scientist with a broad and diverse experience in applied ecological research, education and stakeholder engagement. 
- 🌱 I’m currently working for the University of Exeter's Molecular Ecology & Evolution Group on my DEFRA FISP project called GEMALOR (Genetic Management of Lobster Releases) with the UK's National Lobster Hatchery.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on population genetic research into marine invertebrates, and method development in molecular ecology.
- ⚡ I specialise in areas of crustacean biology, marine conservation, fisheries management, sustainable aquaculture, genetics and interdisciplinary research that creates real-world impact.
